# the multivariate normal distribution, unrestricted (h1), missing values

# 1) loglikelihood --> same as h0 but where Mu and Sigma are unrestricted
# 2) 3) 4) 5)      --> (idem)

# YR 26 March 2016: first version

# here, we estimate Mu and Sigma from Y with missing values, assuming normality
# this is a rewrite of the 'estimate.moments.EM' function in <= 0.5-20
